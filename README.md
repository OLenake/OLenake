# Hi, I'm Onkgopotse

I'm a Software Developer at [Absa Group](https://www.absa.africa/absaafrica/), with specialities in financial services as well as wealth and investment management insurance systems.

I write code on GitHub and looking to collaborate and share my thoughts on [DEV Community](https://dev.to/olenake), a constructive and inclusive social network.

I'm also a member @LenakeTech and @VisionDream, looking to add some of my best work and help with growth and opportunities.
Being a 🐬 in water is life and I enjoy 🍻 , 📚 and nature.
